# Security Policy

## Introduction

Security is a top priority for us. We are committed to maintaining the security of the software and data that powers this project, and we believe that transparency and proactive measures are essential in ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of our project. This document outlines how we handle security issues and vulnerabilities within the project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it to us privately so we can take appropriate action before making the details publicly known. Public disclosure of vulnerabilities can put users at risk, so we ask that vulnerabilities be disclosed responsibly.

### How to report a vulnerability:
- Send an email to our dedicated security team at **security@zenthcloud.com**.
- Include a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it if applicable.
- We also appreciate information on any potential patches or mitigation strategies you may have.

We aim to respond to all reported vulnerabilities within 48 hours, and we will work with you to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

## Security Updates and Patches

We are committed to providing timely security updates. When a security vulnerability is reported, we follow this process:

1. **Assessment**: We assess the severity of the reported vulnerability.
2. **Fix**: If the issue is valid, we will work on a patch immediately.
3. **Release**: Once the patch is tested, we release it as quickly as possible.
4. **Public disclosure**: We will provide public details of the vulnerability and the fix once it has been resolved.

We aim to release security patches within **[x] days** of identifying a critical vulnerability. Less critical vulnerabilities may take longer to address, but we prioritize fixing those that can potentially cause the most harm.

## Secure Coding Practices

Our team follows best practices for secure coding to minimize the chances of vulnerabilities being introduced into the project. We prioritize:

- **Input validation**: Ensuring that input is validated to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Code review**: All code changes undergo review by at least one other team member to catch potential security issues.
- **Dependency management**: We regularly audit the project's dependencies for known security issues. Tools like **Snyk**, **Dependabot**, and **npm audit** help us identify vulnerabilities in our dependencies.
- **Least privilege**: We limit the access of contributors to the project's repositories based on their role to minimize the risk of unauthorized changes.

## Secrets Management

We do not store sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, or tokens in the project’s source code. We recommend using secure vaults and environment variables for managing secrets. In our repository, we use **dotenv** or equivalent tools to manage configuration and secrets securely.

If you need to configure any service or API that requires sensitive data, please ensure that the values are securely stored and not exposed in any public repositories or logs.

## Access Control and Permissions

We follow the principle of least privilege for all contributors and collaborators. Permissions are granted based on the user’s role and the tasks they are responsible for. Specifically:

- **Maintainers** have full control over the project repository, including merge privileges, the ability to add/remove collaborators, and administrative permissions.
- **Contributors** can propose changes via pull requests but are unable to merge their own changes without review from a maintainer.
- **Reporters** and **users** can submit issues or feature requests but do not have access to modify the codebase.

## Conclusion

We take security seriously, and we are committed to continuously improving the security posture of our project. By following these guidelines, we hope to ensure that this project remains secure, trustworthy, and reliable for all users and contributors.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Security Policy, please do not hesitate to contact us at **security@zenthcloud.com**.

Thank you for helping us keep our project secure.
