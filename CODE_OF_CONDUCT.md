# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, and we expect our community to reflect these values.

This Code of Conduct applies to all interactions within the project, including on GitHub issues and pull requests, discussion forums, events, and any other communication channels associated with the project. It also applies to any behavior that can affect the project's reputation, including discussions outside of direct project-related channels.

## Expected Behavior

We expect everyone to:

- **Be respectful and considerate** in your interactions with others.
- **Offer constructive feedback** that is clear and actionable.
- **Value diverse perspectives and experiences** and be open to learning from each other.
- **Use inclusive language** and avoid offensive or discriminatory comments.
- **Promote collaboration and inclusivity**. Encourage participation and make sure that everyone feels heard.

## Unacceptable Behavior

We do not tolerate behavior that is discriminatory, abusive, or otherwise harmful to others, including but not limited to:

- **Harassment**: Offensive comments, insults, or slurs related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, age, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, or any other status.
- **Threats or violence**: Explicit threats, violence, or advocating harm to others.
- **Trolling and spamming**: Disrupting conversations, targeting individuals with unwanted messages, or flooding the discussion with irrelevant or harmful content.
- **Personal attacks**: Ad hominem attacks, accusations, and any form of defamation or vilification.
- **Exclusionary behavior**: Dismissing othersâ€™ ideas, blocking participation, or intentionally silencing others in discussions.

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you experience or witness any violations of this Code of Conduct, please report it to the project maintainers as soon as possible. The project team will review reports and take appropriate action. Reports should be made privately by email to **conduct@zenthcloud.com** to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information.

The following actions may be taken in response to unacceptable behavior:

- **Warning**: A formal warning outlining the violation and expected behavior moving forward.
- **Temporary ban**: A short-term suspension of access to project-related communication channels.
- **Permanent ban**: In severe cases, the individual may be permanently banned from contributing to the project.

Maintainers have the final say in deciding how to handle violations of this Code of Conduct. We believe that a safe and respectful environment is crucial for the success of this project.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to the continuous improvement of this Code of Conduct and its implementation. We encourage community members to contribute to the discussion and evolution of our community guidelines to ensure that they remain relevant and effective.

Thank you for being part of our community and helping us make this project a welcoming and safe place for everyone.
